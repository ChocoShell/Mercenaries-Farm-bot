# User Configuration

This folder is for your custom settings.

Create a file matching the settings file you want to change and add just the settings you want to edit here.

For example:

```ini
# conf/users/combo.ini
[Mercenary]
Chi-Ji=1,1,3
Baron Geddon=2
Ragnaros=2
```

This will override any existing values for those specific mercenaries in `conf/system/combo.ini` while keeping all the other values the same.
